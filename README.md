Simple code to create a color palette website header


This project was created to make a header for my website that had a nice color changing effect. I based the design and code off of an article from Pycodelic:
https://pycodelic.blogspot.com/2020/10/colormaps.html

I edited that code to change the size, rate, and colors. 

Notes: 
I could not find a way to make the gif stop repeating through python. I opened the gif in photoshop and set the animation to repeat only one time and had to resave it before using it. Technically cheating, I know, but it was the only solution I could find at the time.
